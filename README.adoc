= Dynamic Menu in Java

Java project demonstrating the implementation of a dynamic menu using reflection.

== Description

This project provides an example of implementing a dynamic menu in Java using reflection. It allows users to select options from the menu, associating each option with a specific method through annotations.

== Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Run the `Main.java` file to see the dynamic menu in action.

== Project Structure

- `MenuHandler.java`: Contains the main logic for handling the menu.
- `MenuOption.java`: Defines the `@MenuOption` annotation used to annotate menu methods.
- Other files: Contain methods annotated with `@MenuOption` for various menu options.

== Running the Program

To execute the program:

1. Open the project in your IDE.

2. Run the `Main` class as the main class.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to interact with the menu.


== Creating Your Own Dynamic Menu

You can create your own dynamic menu by following these steps:

1. Define a class containing methods representing the various menu options.

2. Annotate each method you want to include in the menu with the `@MenuOption` annotation.

Example:

[source,java]
----
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface MenuOption {
    String name();
    int id(); //if you want to sort the menu options
}
----

3. Retrieve the annotated methods from the class and use them to construct the menu dynamically.

Example:

[source,java]
----
// Retrieve methods from the class and construct the menu
Class<?> yourClass = YourClassContainingMenuMethods.class;
Method[] methods = yourClass.getDeclaredMethods();

for (Method method : methods) {
    if (method.isAnnotationPresent(MenuOption.class)) {
        MenuOption menuOption = method.getAnnotation(MenuOption.class);
        String optionName = menuOption.name();
        // Display the option name and associate it with the method
        // Implement logic to handle user selection and method invocation
    }
}
----

4. Customize the menu behavior based on user selection by invoking the respective methods associated with the chosen options.

This approach allows you to create dynamic menus by utilizing annotated methods within a class, providing flexibility in menu construction based on your specific requirements.

== Notes

- Ensure you have the JDK installed correctly before running the code.
- Customize the menu by adding new options or methods in the `DynamicMenu` or related classes.
